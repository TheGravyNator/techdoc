Give me your hands\\
Show me the door\\
I cannot stand\\
To wait anymore\\
Somebody said\\
Be what you be\\
We could be old and cold and dead on the scene\\

But I love you more than words can say\\
I can't count the reasons I should stay\\

Give me some more\\
Time in a dream\\
Give me the hope to run out of steam\\
Somebody said\\
It could be here\\
We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year\\

I can't count the reasons I should stay\\
One by one they all just fade away\\

I'm tired of the wait and sees\\
I'm tired of that part of me\\
That makes up a perfect lie\\
To keep us busy\\
But hours turn into days\\
So watch what you throw away\\
And be here to recognize\\
There's another way\\

Give me some more\\
Time in a dream\\
Give me the hope to run out of steam\\
Somebody said it\\
could be here\\
We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year\\

But I love you more than words can say\\
I can't count the reasons I should stay\\
One by one they all just fade away\\
Oh I love you more than words can say\\
